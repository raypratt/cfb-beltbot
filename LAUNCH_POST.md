**Title:** 👋 Introducing u/CFBBeltBot - Tracking the CFB Linear Championship Belt! 🏆

**Body:**

Hey r/CFB!

I'm excited to introduce **u/CFBBeltBot**, a bot that tracks the **CFB Linear Championship Belt**!

## 🏆 What's the Linear Championship Belt?

The belt started with the **very first college football game** ever played: **Rutgers beat Princeton 6-4 on November 6, 1869**. Since then, it has passed from winner to winner, like a boxing championship belt. Only the team that beats the current holder can win it!

It's traveled through 155+ years of college football history, creating some wild storylines along the way.

## 🤖 What does the bot do?

**Scheduled Posts:**
- 📅 Weekly belt status updates (Mondays)
- ⚔️ Game day alerts when the belt is on the line
- 🚨 Post-game announcements (belt changes & defenses)

**Commands** (try them out!):
- `!beltbot` - Current belt holder & status
- `!beltbot next` - When is the next belt game?
- `!beltbot history [team]` - Get any team's belt history
- `!beltbot stats` - Overall belt statistics
