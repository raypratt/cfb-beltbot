# Finding Your Reddit Username

Reddit now auto-generates usernames during signup, but you can find your actual username:

## Method 1: Click Your Profile
1. Go to reddit.com and log in
2. Click your profile icon in the top right
3. Look at the dropdown - it shows "u/YourActualUsername"
4. That's your username (NOT the display name)

## Method 2: Check Your Profile URL
1. Click "Profile" in the dropdown
2. Look at the URL: `reddit.com/user/YourActualUsername`
3. That's your username

## Method 3: Old Reddit
1. Go to old.reddit.com
2. Top right corner shows your username directly

## Important Distinction

**Username** (what you need for the bot):
- Starts with u/
- Auto-generated by Reddit (like "Excellent-Belt-7293")
- Cannot be changed
- Used for login and API
- Example: `Important-Belt-1234`

**Display Name** (what shows up to other users):
- What you set to "CFBBeltBot"
- Can be changed anytime
- Shows in comments/posts
- Example: `CFBBeltBot`

## For the Bot

Use your **actual username** (the auto-generated one) in the `.env` file:

```
REDDIT_USERNAME=Important-Belt-1234
```

NOT:
```
REDDIT_USERNAME=CFBBeltBot  # ‚ùå This is the display name
```

## If You Want a Clean Username

Unfortunately, Reddit doesn't let you change your username. Options:

1. **Use the auto-generated one** - Works fine! The display name "CFBBeltBot" is what users see
2. **Create a new account** - On desktop web:
   - Use old.reddit.com
   - During signup, you can choose your own username
   - Pick "CFBBeltBot" as the username

## Recommendation

**Just use the auto-generated username!** It works perfectly fine for the bot. Users will see "CFBBeltBot" as the display name in posts/comments, which is what matters.

The actual username only matters for:
- Logging in
- API authentication (bot config)
- Username mentions (but people will use the display name)

## Testing

Once you have your username, test that it works:

```bash
python data_fetcher.py
```

If that works, your credentials are correct!
