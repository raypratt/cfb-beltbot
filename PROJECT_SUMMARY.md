## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Game result detection** - Currently manual, needs to be triggered or check data source
2. **Week calculation** - Approximate, could use actual schedule data
3. **Team name matching** - Uses simple fuzzy matching, could be improved
4. **No database** - Relies entirely on Google Sheets (works fine, but could be faster with DB)
5. **Rate limits** - New Reddit accounts have posting restrictions (build karma first)

- Check for errors
- Respond to any issues

### Weekly
- Review analytics
